# Melinda-Text-Dataset
Official repository for the Opensource Text dataset for NMT for local languages in West Africa (EWE Corpus) and implement the Yodi model after hand. 

Note: This repository will evolve into the official repository for the Yodi model, once the necessary data is gathered.

# Objective

##### â€¢ Develop a Machine Translation Text and Speech Dataset NMT for local languages in West Africa (EWE Corpus)

# Key Results 

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy or the performance of the Yodi model from this dataset for text-to-text translation.

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy of Yodi built from this dataset for Speech recognition.

##### Remark: Getting accurate data and labeled data from available sources online or in local written papers would be necessary for machine sentence translation. 

# Ongoing

####### -> Develop the metrics for the dataset, How many total sentences for each file, and how many words?

Feel free to add your labeled or unlabeled NMT data to the repository and perform the measurements as well.
