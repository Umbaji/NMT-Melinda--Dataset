# Melinda-Text-Dataset
Official repository for the Opensource Textdataset for NMT for local langues in West Africa (EWE Corpus) and implement the Yodi model afterhand. 

Note : This repository will elvolve intto the official repository for the Yodi model, once the necessary data is gathered.

# Objective

##### â€¢ Develop a Machine Translation Text and Speech Dataset NMT for local langues in West Africa (EWE Corpus)
Task 1 Data celaning orginial text available here : https://togochretien.com/ewe-matthieu/ ( change the ewe-matthieu to ewe-chapter_name to get the proper web page)

# Key Results 

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy or the performance of the Yodi model from this dataset for text to text translation.

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy of Yodi built from this dataset for Speech recognition.

##### Remark : Getting accurate data and labelled data from available source onlie or in local written papers would be necessary for machine sentence translation. 

Feel free to add your labelled or unlabeled NMT data to the repository.
