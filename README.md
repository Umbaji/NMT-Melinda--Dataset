# Melinda-Text-Dataset
Official repository for the Opensource Textdataset for NMT for local langues in West Africa (EWE Corpus) and implement the Yodi model afterhand. 

Note : This repository will elvolve intto the official repository for the Yodi model, once the necessary data is gathered.

# Objective

##### â€¢ Develop a Machine Translation Text and Speech Dataset NMT for local langues in West Africa (EWE Corpus)

# Key Results 

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy or the performance of the Yodi model from this dataset for text to text translation.

###### -> Develop & Measure the accuracy of Yodi built from this dataset for Speech recognition.

##### Remark : Getting accurate data and labelled data from available source onlie or in local written papers would be necessary for machine sentence translation. 

# Ongoing

####### -> Develop the metrics for the dataset, How many total sentences for each files and how many words ?

Feel free to add your labelled or unlabeled NMT data to the repository and perform the measurements as well.
