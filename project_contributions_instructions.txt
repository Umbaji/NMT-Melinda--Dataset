#_This file  explains the main tasks to achieve regarding the Melinda Text Dataset_

### N.B. Please make sure you save the files in the appropriate folder :
        
        1- Vocal: for vocal scrapped data different from umni_speech.
            a-) root_{langauge}: for the original record in Ewe/
            i.e. root_ewe is the root folder for vocal data from Ewe
            b-) translated_{language}
            i.e. root_en is the folder for translated records in English
            
        
        2 - Text : 
            Original_text: save the content into a CSV file
                 Label your original sentence in Ewe and add the 
                 metadata in the CSV by paying attention that it is numbered.
            Translated_data: save the translated content
                 Label your translated sentence in En/Fr and add the 
                 metadata in the CSV by paying attention that it is numbered.
             
        3 - Please ensure to save a CSV/JSON version of your dataset as well.
        
        4 - Enter the necessary data processing remarks on the file named {dataset_name}_oremarks.txt

## What is left to do : 

### 1 - Add natural recording to the vocal data by recording their note in different settings, for umni_speech.
        For general audio data, make sure to input the transcript in translated or original_text, in the folder vocal transcript.
        If you are contributing, you should add your data in a folder related to your data under each of the main folders. for example, if you are adding general vocal Ew√® data, you would add it under the          corresponding number such that the file path for the vocal data is Vocal/root_ewe/p_{your_index} and for the transcripts Text/original_text/p_{your_index}
        You can also simply add the corresponding French input. The recording will be in Vocal/translated_fr/p_{your_index}
### 2 - Build a data augmentation model especially. the ideal algorithm can translate male data into female data or change the tone of the audio. The 250 copy files are input for data augmentation.

### 3 - Build the necessary data analytics (automated).
